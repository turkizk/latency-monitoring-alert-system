# Latency Monitoring & Alert System

This project demonstrates a proactive latency monitoring approach
designed to detect performance degradation before it impacts users.

---

## 🎯 Problem

In production environments, latency issues do not always trigger errors,
but they can significantly affect user experience and system reliability.

The challenge was to identify abnormal latency patterns early
and notify the team before incidents escalated.

---

## 🔍 Approach

Using APM and Trace Analytics:

- Monitored critical endpoints
- Identified latency thresholds
- Configured proactive alerts
- Integrated notifications via Slack

---

## 🚀 Solution

A latency alert system was created to:

- Detect requests exceeding 5 seconds
- Notify the team in real-time
- Enable faster incident response
- Shift monitoring from reactive to proactive

---

## 📈 Impact

- Faster detection of performance issues
- Reduced user impact
- Improved observability practices
- Better team awareness and collaboration

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- APM Monitoring
- Trace Analytics
- Slack Alerts
- Observability dashboards

## 📊 Alert Example

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Small improvements in observability can lead to significant gains
in production reliability.
